# Task ID: 23
# Title: Create Eloquent Models with Relationships
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop all Eloquent models with proper relationships, accessors, mutators, and scopes
# Details:
Create the following models with relationships:
1. `User` - hasMany interactions, hasMany opportunities
2. `Organization` - hasMany contacts, hasMany interactions, hasMany opportunities
3. `Contact` - belongsTo organization, hasMany interactions, hasMany opportunities
4. `Interaction` - belongsTo organization, belongsTo contact, belongsTo user
5. `Opportunity` - belongsTo organization, belongsTo contact, belongsTo user
6. `Principal` - hasMany productLines
7. `ProductLine` - belongsTo principal
8. `Setting` - No relationships

Implement accessors/mutators for formatting data and scopes for common queries (e.g., priorityLevel for organizations, activeOpportunities, etc.)

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for each model
2. Test relationship loading with eager loading
3. Verify accessors and mutators work correctly
4. Test custom scopes with various parameters
5. Ensure proper JSON serialization of models
