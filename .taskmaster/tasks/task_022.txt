Create migrations for the following tables:
1. `users` - Standard Laravel users table with role field
2. `organizations` - Fields: id, name, address, phone, email, website, priority (high/medium/low), created_at, updated_at

Ensure proper foreign key constraints and indexes for performance.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run migrations with `php artisan migrate`
2. Verify schema with `php artisan db:show`
3. Create test data insertion script
4. Test foreign key constraints by attempting invalid operations
5. Verify indexes with database inspection tools
