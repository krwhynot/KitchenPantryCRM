# Task ID: 22
# Title: Design and Implement Database Schema
# Status: completed
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive database schema for all entities including organizations, contacts, interactions, and sales pipeline
# Details:
Create migrations for the following tables:
1. `users` - Standard Laravel users table with role field
2. `organizations` - Fields: id, name, address, phone, email, website, priority (high/medium/low), created_at, updated_at
3. `contacts` - Fields: id, organization_id, first_name, last_name, title, email, phone, notes, created_at, updated_at
4. `interactions` - Fields: id, organization_id, contact_id, user_id, type, date, notes, created_at, updated_at
5. `opportunities` - Fields: id, organization_id, contact_id, user_id, title, description, value, stage (lead/prospect/proposal/negotiation/closed), status (open/won/lost), created_at, updated_at
6. `principals` - Fields: id, name, description, created_at, updated_at
7. `product_lines` - Fields: id, principal_id, name, description, created_at, updated_at
8. `settings` - Fields: id, key, value, created_at, updated_at

Ensure proper foreign key constraints and indexes for performance.

# Test Strategy:
1. Run migrations with `php artisan migrate`
2. Verify schema with `php artisan db:show`
3. Create test data insertion script
4. Test foreign key constraints by attempting invalid operations
5. Verify indexes with database inspection tools
