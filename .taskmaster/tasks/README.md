## Task Management Guidelines

### Task File Structure
Each task file should contain:
- **Objective**: Clear description of what needs to be accomplished
- **Status**: Current completion state (Pending, In Progress, Completed)
- **Implementation Details**: Technical approach and requirements
- **Files Created/Modified**: List of affected files
- **Testing**: Verification steps and test results
- **Completion Date**: When task was finished

### Status Tracking
- **Pending**: ‚è≥ Task not yet started
- **In Progress**: üîÑ Currently being worked on
- **Completed**: ‚úÖ Task finished and verified
- **Blocked**: ‚õî Waiting on dependencies
- **Cancelled**: ‚ùå Task no longer needed

### Numbering Convention
- Tasks numbered sequentially (task_021.txt, task_022.txt, etc.)
- Maintain chronological order based on creation date
- Do not reuse numbers from deleted tasks

## Integration with Project Workflow

### Development Process
1. **Create Task**: Define objective and requirements
2. **Implementation**: Execute technical work
3. **Testing**: Verify functionality and quality
4. **Documentation**: Update task with results
5. **Review**: Validate completion criteria
6. **Status Update**: Mark as completed

### Dependencies
- Task completion may depend on previous tasks
- Reference dependencies in task files
- Update dependent tasks when prerequisites change

### Quality Assurance
- All tasks should include testing requirements
- Document verification steps clearly
- Include performance and security considerations
