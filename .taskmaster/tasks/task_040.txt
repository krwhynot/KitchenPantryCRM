# Task ID: 40
# Title: Perform Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 30, 32, 33, 38, 39
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize application for sub-second search, 2-second page loads, and 10-second report generation
# Details:
1. Implement database query optimization
2. Add database indexes for common queries
3. Implement caching strategy
4. Optimize Eloquent queries with eager loading
5. Implement asset minification and bundling
6. Add lazy loading for images
7. Implement pagination optimization
8. Create performance monitoring tools
9. Optimize Filament resources
10. Implement database query logging and analysis
11. Add performance testing suite

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure search response time to ensure sub-second target
2. Test page load times to ensure 2-second target
3. Measure report generation time to ensure 10-second target
4. Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
5. Test with simulated high load
6. Verify caching works correctly
7. Monitor performance in production environment
