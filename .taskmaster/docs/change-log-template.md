# Change Log Template

This template provides a standardized format for tracking file changes within project directories.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Copy the template section** below into your directory's README.md file
2. **Update the directory description** to match your folder's purpose
3. **Document baseline state** for existing files
4. **Log all changes** using the specified format
5. **Keep entries chronological** (newest first)

## Template

```markdown
# [Directory Name]

## Directory Purpose
[Brief description of what this directory contains and its role in the project]

## Best Practices

### Change Descriptions
- **Be specific**: "Updated user validation rules" vs "Modified file"
- **Include context**: "Added new test for database connectivity" 
- **Reference issues**: "Fixed bug #123 in login validation"
- **Note breaking changes**: "BREAKING: Changed API response format"

### Maintenance
- **Update immediately**: Log changes when they happen
- **Review regularly**: Ensure log accuracy during code reviews
- **Archive old entries**: Move entries older than 6 months to archive section
- **Standardize format**: Maintain consistent formatting across all directories

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Integration
Change logs complement git history by providing:
- **Business context** for technical changes
- **Impact assessment** for reviewers
- **Quick reference** without git log diving

### Code Reviews
Include change log updates in pull requests:
- **Verify accuracy**: Ensure logged changes match actual modifications
- **Check completeness**: Confirm all significant changes are documented
- **Validate format**: Maintain consistent formatting standards

### Release Management
Use change logs to:
- **Generate release notes**: Extract user-facing changes
- **Track technical debt**: Identify areas needing attention
- **Plan migrations**: Understand breaking changes over time
