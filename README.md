```

- **FIXED**: Bug fix or correction
- **REFACTORED**: Major structural changes

### Directory Coverage
The following directories have active change tracking:
- `.taskmaster/tasks/` - Project task management
- `tests/Feature/Smoke/` - Smoke testing suite  
- `app/Models/` - Eloquent models and relationships
- `database/migrations/` - Database schema changes
- `database/factories/` - Model factories for testing
- `app/Filament/Resources/` - Admin panel resources
- `app/Livewire/` - Interactive UI components
- `config/` - Application configuration files

### Using the Change Tracking System
1. **When modifying files**: Update the appropriate directory's README.md
2. **Follow the format**: Use the standardized YYYY-MM-DD | filename | type | description format
3. **Be descriptive**: Include meaningful descriptions of changes
4. **Update immediately**: Log changes when they happen, not later

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
