## Model Architecture Overview

### Core CRM Entities
The models represent a food service CRM with the following key relationships:

```
Organization (Companies/Restaurants)
â”œâ”€â”€ hasMany â†’ Contact (Individual contacts at organizations)
â”œâ”€â”€ hasMany â†’ Interaction (Communications and meetings)
â”œâ”€â”€ hasMany â†’ Opportunity (Sales opportunities)
â””â”€â”€ hasMany â†’ Contract (Signed agreements)

Principal (Food service suppliers)
â”œâ”€â”€ hasMany â†’ ProductLine (Product categories/brands)
â””â”€â”€ hasManyThrough â†’ Opportunity (via product lines)

User (System users)
â”œâ”€â”€ hasMany â†’ Interaction (User-generated interactions)
â””â”€â”€ hasMany â†’ Opportunity (Assigned opportunities)
```

### Enhanced Features (Task 23 Implementation)

#### Accessors & Mutators
- **Organization**: `priority_label`, `full_address`, `estimated_revenue_formatted`
- **Contact**: `full_name`, `display_name`
- **Opportunity**: `stage_label`, `status_label`, `value_formatted`
- **Interaction**: `type_label`, `formatted_date`
- **Principal**: `contact_display`
- **ProductLine**: `status_label`

#### Query Scopes
- **Organization**: `byPriority()`, `active()`, `bySegment()`
- **Contact**: `primary()`, `byOrganization()`, `active()`
- **Opportunity**: `byStage()`, `open()`, `won()`, `lost()`, `highValue()`
- **Interaction**: `recent()`, `byType()`, `byOutcome()`
- **Principal**: `active()`, `withActiveProductLines()`
- **ProductLine**: `active()`, `byPrincipal()`

### Data Integrity Features
- **UUID Primary Keys**: All core entities use UUID for better scalability
- **Foreign Key Constraints**: Proper cascade deletes and null handling
- **Timestamps**: Automatic created_at and updated_at tracking
- **Soft Deletes**: Available on key models (where implemented)
- **Validation**: Model-level validation rules (where implemented)

### Testing Coverage
All enhanced models include:
- âœ… **Unit Tests**: Individual model functionality testing
- âœ… **Factory Support**: Comprehensive model factories for testing
- âœ… **Relationship Tests**: Validation of model associations
- âœ… **Integration Tests**: Cross-model functionality testing
- âœ… **Performance Tests**: N+1 query prevention and eager loading

## Development Guidelines

### Adding New Models
1. Create model class with appropriate relationships
2. Define factory for testing data generation
3. Add unit tests for model functionality
4. Document relationships in this README
5. Update change log with model addition

### Modifying Existing Models
1. Add appropriate accessors/mutators for data formatting
2. Implement useful query scopes for common operations
3. Update or add tests for new functionality
4. Document changes in this README
5. Consider backward compatibility

### Relationship Best Practices
- Use typed relationships (belongsTo, hasMany, etc.)
- Implement cascade deletes appropriately
- Add foreign key constraints in migrations
- Use eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
- Document complex relationships clearly

### Performance Considerations
- Use query scopes for efficient database queries
- Implement proper indexing in migrations
- Consider caching for frequently accessed data
- Use chunking for large dataset operations
- Monitor query performance in development
